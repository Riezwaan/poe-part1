CyberGuard Bot is a beginner-friendly C# console chatbot focused on cybersecurity awareness. 
It starts by playing a welcome sound and displaying an ASCII art logo to greet the user. 
The bot then asks for the user's name and responds with a personalized greeting. 
Users can ask questions related to cybersecurity, such as passwords, phishing, or malware. 
Based on keywords in the question, the bot provides simple and helpful safety tips. 
The chat continues until the user types "exit" to end the session.
